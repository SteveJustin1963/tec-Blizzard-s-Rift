### Blizzards-Rift

Latrine's Lost Tombs is a game for one or two players.  Each player controls a ship and must navigate around the tombs, avoiding the gun turrets and sentries, and collect as many gems as possible.  The first player to reach the teleporter will be taken back to the star system navigation screen to select their next destination.  The game ends when both players have reached the teleporter.

The game is played using the following controls:

9 Rotate anticlockwise
0 Rotate clockwise
2 Thrust
M Fire/Shop
H Pause

These keys may be changed by selecting the Redefine Keys option from the main menu.  Alternatively, use a joystick connected via a Kempston or Sinclair interface.

Tips:

Take it slowly and steadily, practice makes perfect.
Try to attack gun turrets from below as they only have a 180 degree range.
Booster rockets make it easier to navigate, but burn fuel more quickly.

### extending this story

As the two ships approach the teleporter, they find themselves under attack from a horde of scavengers and bandits.  The ship's shields hold firm, but the two ships are quickly surrounded.  The scavengers and bandits are armed with a variety of weapons, and it soon becomes clear that they are not going to give up easily.

The two ships fight their way through the enemy fleet, destroying as many as possible.  Eventually they reach the teleporter and are safely transported back to the star system navigation screen.  They have earned a reputation as tough opponents, and word of their exploits spreads quickly through the galaxy.  They soon find themselves in demand as mercenaries, hired by others to protect their ships and tombs from the ever-growing number of scavengers and bandits.

Latrine's black box contains the coordinates of a time portal which he discovered while exploring the tombs.  The two ships find the portal and enter it, emerging in a strange and unfamiliar time.  They are quickly attacked by a fleet of enemy ships, and must fight their way back to the portal and return to their own time.and warn the others
